"""
Inventory Management Script (Mock for Replit or Local Use)

Simulates retrieving and displaying mock network device inventory using REST APIs.

‚úîÔ∏è How it meets project requirements:
- Simulates inventory management by retrieving device data from a mock REST API.
- Demonstrates use of external APIs using HTTP GET requests.
- Presents the data as network devices with status and type (mocked).

üì¶ Tools Used:
- Python 3
- requests module (for HTTP requests)
- jsonplaceholder.typicode.com (free mock API for demo/testing)

üîß Techniques Applied:
- REST API interaction via GET method
- Parsing JSON response
- Iterating through and formatting device entries for readable output
"""

def get_inventory():
    """
    Sends a GET request to the mock API to retrieve fake device data.
    Parses and prints key attributes like ID, hostname, and simulated device info.
    """
    response = requests.get(INVENTORY_ENDPOINT)  # Make the HTTP GET request
    devices = response.json()  # Parse the JSON response into a Python list of dicts

    # Loop through each 'device' (simulated user) in the mock response
    for device in devices:
