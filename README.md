# DCN420-SDN-Controller-Mock-Scripts
Simulated SDN controller scripting using Python and REST API mockups. Includes ticket handling, inventory queries, flow analysis, and network configuration updates. Completed for DCN420 at Seneca Polytechnic.
# SDN Controller Mock Scripting ‚Äì DCN420 Term Project (Part 3)

## üß† Overview
As part of a term project for DCN420, our group was responsible for Part 3: scripting controller functionality via REST APIs. Due to limitations with Packet Tracer, which doesn't support REST API interaction, we implemented **mock Python scripts** to simulate expected controller tasks.

Each script reflects real-world SDN controller logic: from ticket creation to flow analysis and network updates ‚Äî all via simulated REST API requests and responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Simulated Features

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `1. Ticket_handeling.py` | Creates, lists, and updates mock tickets using a fake API |
| `2. Inventory_management.py` | Retrieves mock device inventory from JSONPlaceholder |
| `3. Flow_analysis.py` | Simulates packet flow tracing across hops |
| `4. Device_host_config.py` | Emulates hostname config changes on mock devices |
| `5. Update_network-wide_settings.py` | Mimics network-wide config push via pseudo-API |
