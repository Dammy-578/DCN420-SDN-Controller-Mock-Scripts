Network-Wide Settings Update Script (Final Submission Version)

‚úÖ Purpose:
Simulates sending network-wide configuration updates ‚Äî specifically for NTP and SYSLOG settings ‚Äî
as would be done through a network controller or SDN API.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Python 3 (standard interpreter)
- No external libraries needed for simulation

üîß Techniques Used:
- Function-based approach for modular code
- Parameterized inputs to simulate dynamic configuration
- Printed output to simulate REST API response

üìê Why This Is a Mock:
In a real environment, such updates would be performed by sending
HTTP POST/PUT requests to a network controller (like Cisco DNA Center or an SDN controller).
Since Packet Tracer does not allow this externally, we simulate the API behavior by printing expected actions.
"""

# This mock version only prints what would be sent to a real API

    """
    Simulates pushing NTP and SYSLOG server settings to the network.
    
    Parameters:
    ntp_ip (str): IP address of the NTP (time) server
    syslog_ip (str): IP address of the SYSLOG (logging) server

    Procedure:
    - Accepts two IP addresses (one for NTP, one for SYSLOG)
    - Prints simulated REST API configuration push

    print(f"SYSLOG Server: {syslog_ip}")  # Show simulated SYSLOG server IP
