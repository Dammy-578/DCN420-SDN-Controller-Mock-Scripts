Flow Analysis Script (Final Version for Submission)

‚úÖ Purpose:
Simulates a network flow trace from a source host to a destination host,
emulating how SDN controllers or tools like `traceroute` show network paths.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Python 3.x
- Standard console output (no external libraries needed)

üìê Techniques Used:
- Static data to simulate intermediate devices ("hops")
- Clear separation of logic using a function
- Parameterized source and destination IPs
"""

def trace_flow(src_ip, dst_ip):
    """
    Simulates tracing a network flow between two endpoints.

    Parameters:
    src_ip (str): The IP address of the source host.
    dst_ip (str): The IP address of the destination host.

    Procedure:
    - Define a fixed list of mock devices representing the network path.
    - Each device has a name and the interface used.
    - Print each hop in the sequence to mimic flow analysis output.
